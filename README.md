# Blue 7 labs

Here are some experiments for Blue 7.

List of demo pages:
* [groundup-1](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-7-labs/groundup-1)
* [pro-sidebar](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-7-labs/pro-sidebar)


## Create new demo build
`/groundup-1` has the script `move-to-docs.js`. It moves the `build` folder to `/docs/groundup-1`. This way it will be published via GitHub pages under https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-7-labs/groundup-1.

When you create another subfolder with a CRA project, you can can copy the script to there and use the same aproach to publish your demo. Remember to rename everything to how you titled your project folder. 
When you published a demo, please add the link to the list above.
